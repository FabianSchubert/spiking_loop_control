This is a GeNN implementation of a spiking network for closed loop control as described in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.12887.pdf

* A simple example using the SpikeNet network class can be found in `spiking_loop_control/main_spikenet.py`.
* If you have pygame and GeNN installed, you can run an interactive session using `python3 -m phys_models.interactive`
where a 2D robotic arm is controlled using a spiking network run in GeNN (you can click on the screen to set the reaching
target).
